# Neural Networks: Building Deep Understanding

This project is a tutorial designed to help learners understand the step-by-step process of building a neural network from scratch. The implementation is highly modular, emphasizing simplicity and clarity over optimization. The goal is to provide an approachable guide for individuals looking to grasp the fundamental concepts of neural networks and their components through Python code.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into seven parts. Each part builds upon the previous ones to incrementally construct a fully functional neural network capable of solving real-world classification tasks.

### **Part 01: Wiring Up the Network**

This part focuses on the physical structure of the network. It defines a framework that simplifies future challenges by abstracting away concerns about the overall shape of the network, allowing us to focus on individual nodes and their local relationships with neighbors.Â 

### **Part 02: Forward Propagation**

Here, forward propagation is implemented to demonstrate how inputs pass through the network to produce outputs. The mechanics of weighted sums and activation functions are explored.

### **Part 03: Backpropagating Error Signal**

This section covers part of the backpropagation algorithm, explaining how to quantify each node's impact on the total error by propagating error contributions backward through the network.&#x20;

### **Part 04: Gradient Descent**

Gradient descent is introduced as the optimization algorithm for updating weights in the network.&#x20;

### **Part 05: Training and Metrics**

This part covers training the neural network on a dataset and calculating performance metrics.

### **Part 06: Visualization**

Visualization techniques are demonstrated by plotting data and functions to observe their alignment, providing insights into how the network represents relationships in the data.

### **Part 07: A Real Classification Task**

The tutorial culminates with a real-world classification task using the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits. The data is loaded, preprocessed, and used to train the network, demonstrating its practical application.
